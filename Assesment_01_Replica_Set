DaemonSets are used to ensure that some or all of your K8S nodes run a copy of a pod, which allows you to run a daemon on every node.

When you add a new node to the cluster, a pod gets added to match the nodes. Similarly, when you remove a node from your cluster, the pod is put into the trash. Deleting a DaemonSet cleans up the pods that it previously created.

A Daemonset is another controller that manages pods like Deployments, ReplicaSets, and StatefulSets. It was created for one particular purpose: ensuring that the pods it manages to run on all the cluster nodes. As soon as a node joins the cluster, the DaemonSet ensures that it has the necessary pods running on it. When the node leaves the cluster, those pods are garbage collected.

Daemonset in Kubernetes is used when we need to schedule the copy of one POD in all the worker nodes. So if we have a requirement to run one copy of our POD in all the worker nodes then it is best to use Daemonset.

UseCases
===================
a)  running a cluster storage daemon on every node
b)  running a logs collection daemon on every node
c)  running a node monitoring daemon on every node
