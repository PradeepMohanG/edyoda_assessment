1) Login to Kubernetes Master or the node from we can run 'kubectl' command
2) Check the service using the below command
  kubectl get svc -n <NameSpace>
3) Check if the Nodeport service is running
4) If it is running, first try to run a curl command using the <Master IP>:<NodePort>
5) If the above is not working, run curl command with the Cluster IP and port 8000
6) If above is also not working, then describe the POD and check the label using the 'kubectl describe svc' command
7) Assume the label is 'app=web-ui', Now based on the label identify the POD using the below command
  kubectl get pods -n <Namespace> --show-labels | grep 'app=web-ui'
8) Now we got the POD based on label, first check what is the POD state
9) If the POD state is in running, then login to POD using 'kubectl exec' and 
  a) Check if the POD is listening on the port as defined
  b) check the application log to identify the issue

We should be able to identify the issue with the above steps.
