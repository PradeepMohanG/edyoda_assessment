Since there is only one replica configured for the Deployment. First we should scale the deployment and make the replica to 2

Assume 'nginx-deployment' is the deployment name, execute the below command to increase the replicas from 1 to 2
#######################
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment nginx-deployment -n <Namespace>

Once the scaling is completed, make sure the number of PODs are now 2 using the below command

kubectl get pods -n <Namespace>

Now there are two ways to change the image name, 
  a) By editing the deployment using 'kubectl edit' command
  ===========================================================
  1. kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment -n <NameSpace>
  2. Now we will get a popup, edit the image now and save
  3. Once step 2 is completed, the POD will get recreated one after the other. So always one POD will be there to handle the requests
  
  b) By modifying  the yaml and running 'kubectl apply' command
  1. Open the deployment.yaml file
  2. Modify the image name
  3. Run, the below command
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n <NameSpace>
    Once step 2 is completed, the POD will get recreated one after the other. So always one POD will be there to handle the requests
    
 Now we can scale down the replicas to 1 as the upgrade is completed using the below command
 kubectl scale --replicas=1 deployment nginx-deployment -n <Namespace>
